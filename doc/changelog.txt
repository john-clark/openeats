
Open Eats Change Log
=================================================

Version 0.0.1 02/21/06

Initial release of Open Eats.  The frame work has been started, a rough design for the database
has been loaded.  As of right now you can add recipes to the database and list the recipes.
Still lacking the ability to add ingredients, select categories, and add directions for a recipe.

Version 0.0.2 02/25/06

===Database Changes===

-Removed OE from all the tables.

-Added Difficulty column to the Recipe Table.

-Added Directions column to the Recipe Table.

-Changed the time stamp columns to be called created_at (Symfony will automatically add system time to these columns with no user input needed)

===Recipe Module===

You can now select the course, difficulty, and ethntity for a recipe.  You can also add directions for
recipe.  The course and ethnicity does not update any db tables yet. Not sure how to do forieng key updates to another model in Symfony/Propel. Hopefully the next release I will of figured this out

Version 0.0.3 02/27/06

===Database Changes===

No databases changes where made accept to add data so the courses and ethnicity will display. SQL dump is included.


===Recipe Module===

-Replaced repeated code with a clase in the recipe action file under the executeEdit function

-Fixed an error where the difficulty was not updating the database

-Added some code to the editSuccess.php template file so that the difficulty defaults in the dropdown to what the actual recipe has it set to in the database

-Slowly learning how to use Many to Many.  I wrote a few functions to add to the recipe class to display what course and ethnicity a recipe is in.  Still working on being able to edit that and have it save.  Right now you have to go into the database and update the join tables.

-Wrote a couple of custom classes to get rid of some repeated code.  They are located under apps/openeats/lib/changearray and column select.  I need to start adding comments to my code I will do that in the next release.

Version 0.0.4 02/28/06

==Recipe Module==

-When you add a recipe the Course will now update the recipe_category table

-When you add a recipe the ethnticity will now update the recipe_ethncity table

IF you try to update a recipe that already exsits you will get an error.  I need to work on making sure that the recipe is not already there and if it is to only update the Category_ID/Ethnticy_ID column in that table and not make a new entry.

Version 0.0.5 03/01/06

==Recipe Module==

-You can now update a recipe and change the category or ethnicity and it will update the join table


Version 0.0.6 03/04/06

==Recipe Module==

-When you delete a recipe, the recoreds in the ethnicity and category table are also removed

-Initial form validation is in place

-Removed Serving Size from the form to create recipes.  I don't think we will end up using this in the long run.  I left the db column for it just in case we decide to come back and use this.

-Removed the display of serving size

Version 0.0.7 03/09/06

==Database==

-Created a batch load script found under /batch/load_data.php.  With a data file found under data/fixtures/ingrd.yml.  Run php load_data.php and the ingriedents table will be populated with 250+ ingriedents

-Added a dev and prod db connection to databases.yml

==Recipe Module==

-Courses now default in the drop down menu under edit mode to what is the current course of the recipe

-Ethnicity now defaults in the drop down menu under edit mode to what is the current ethnticity of the recipe

-Fixed a routing issue where the production "index.php" was not working properly
-Changed the link to the recipe to the recipe name instead of the recipe id

==Symfony==

Version 0.0.8 03/16/06

-Removed the ability to delete recipes (this will be added back into the admin interface)

Version 0.0.9 04/01/06

==Recipe Modlue==

Changed the way ingridients are added and removed.  You can now add/remove ingridients to a new or current recipe.  You can also add additional select tags for more ingridients options.

Ingredients of a current recipe now appear in a div statmenet on the edit page with a X next to them allowing you to remove them and it takes you back to the form

When adding new ingredients to a current recipe, the old ingreidents do not get removed by default unless you are re-adding the same ingredient again.
